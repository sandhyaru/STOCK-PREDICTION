# Stock Market Prediction 📈
This is my second data science project as part of my CodeClause internship. This project involves using data science technique, that is, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, to predict stock market prices. The goal is to create an accurate model for stock price prediction and provide visualizations and reports on its performance.


## Description 🖋️
The project aims to develop a predictive model for stock market prices using deep learning techniques, with a primary focus on LSTM neural networks. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for their ability to capture sequential patterns and dependencies in time-series data, making them well-suited for stock price prediction.


## Dataset 📓

Here is the dataset from Kaggle that I used to build the model:

## Overview 🗒️

### Skills and Tools:

👉 Python for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation. <br>
👉 Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization. <br>
👉 Deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for building and training LSTM models.<br>
👉 Knowledge of time-series analysis and financial indicators.<br>
